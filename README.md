stclient
========

Unofficial sharedtalk client. Written in Python 2.x (2.7+?)
Uses PyQt or PySide for the GUI.
Supports only a sub-set of sharedtalk features, namely public and private chat rooms.
Does not support registration, mailboxes and whatnot.
Adds some minor features which their site doesn't have, like ignoring specific users 
or removing all their messages (client-side, of course).
